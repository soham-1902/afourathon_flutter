## Setting up the developer machine

### Install the Flutter SDK:

Visit the Flutter website at https://flutter.dev/ and download the Flutter SDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Extract the downloaded package to a desired location on your machine.

### Set up Flutter Environment Variables:-

### Add the Flutter SDK path to your system's environment variables:
For macOS and Linux: Open the terminal and run the following command: export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]/flutter/bin"
For Windows: Open the system's "Environment Variables" settings and add the Flutter SDK's bin directory to the PATH variable.

### Install Dart SDK:
Flutter relies on the Dart programming language. Download the Dart SDK from https://dart.dev/get-dart and install it on your machine.

### Configure an Editor:
Flutter supports various code editors such as Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and others.
Choose an editor and install the relevant Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions for that editor.

### Run Flutter Doctor:
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the command flutter doctor. This command checks your system for any necessary dependencies or configuration issues and provides recommendations on how to resolve them.

### Install Android Studio (for Android development):
If you plan to develop Flutter apps for Android, download and install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio.
During installation, make sure to select the option to install the Android SDK and set up the necessary Android Virtual Device (AVD).

### iOS Setup (for iOS development):
If you plan to develop Flutter apps for iOS, you'll need a macOS machine and Xcode installed.
Install Xcode from the Mac App Store and make sure to open it at least once to accept the license agreement and install additional components.

### Verify the Installation:
After completing the above steps, run flutter doctor again in the terminal or command prompt to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
With these steps completed, the developer machine is set up for Flutter development.

Also, in future Ia have plan to deploy the app on play store so that the users can easily access the application.
